# Listto

A bot for lists!

A handy little thing for some list management services that you might want on your Discord server.
You can create lists, add and remove values, and edit them too!

You can invite Listto [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=729965867093459004&permissions=2048&scope=bot)
and be sure to start of with ^h or ^help to see what it can do!
